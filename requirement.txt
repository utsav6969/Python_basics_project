1- Purpose and Scope
	This is a python program which will return or suggest a "Vehicle Number" on the basis 
	of the given "State Name" and the "Location of RTO" given by the user.

2 - Goals
	The main goal of the program is to suggest a number to the user on the basis of the
	location entered by the user.
	The Vehicle number generated by the program should consist the correct State code and
	RTO code in it.

3 - Overview and Uses
	Firstly the program will ask the user for the State Name. And then it'll ask for the location
	then the program will search the name of the state and its respective location in the data which
	is stored in a separate JSON file. 
	Then the program will show the Vehicle number which consist of the State Code, RTO Code and a 
	randomly generated 4 digit number.

4 - Constraints
	As I have populated the limited data in my JSON file. So the vehicle number will be generated for
	only those locations which are present in the JSON file. If the input State name or Location is not
	present in the data, then the program will not be able to generate the Vehicle number.
